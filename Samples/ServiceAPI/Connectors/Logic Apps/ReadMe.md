# Logic Apps Connector

Microsoft Azure Logic Apps connectors are defined using [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). While it is possible to generate an OpenAPI description for the entire ServiceAPI this is not suitable for creating a Logic Apps connector because of its size and complexity.

This OpenAPI file is a small subset of the ServiceAPI supporting only very simple record creation and searching. Depending on demand this could grow to either a more comprehensive definition or a tool to generate a bespoke definition (e.g. including 'additional fields').

## Usage

The custom connector can be created within an Azure subscription following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/define-openapi-definition).

## Edit the OpenAPI before using

The OpenAPI definition provided here assumes that your:

- web server hostname is 'localhost', and
- ServiceAPI path is '/ServiceAPI'

Ensure you change these before uploading the file to your custom connector.

## On Premise Gateway

If you plan to use the [On Premise gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install) to interact with an On Premise CM instance ensure you check the 'Connect via on-premises data gateway' option.
